# Dear Diary For US

This web application is specifically designed for couples, providing them with a private platform to maintain a shared diary. Within this app, users can write personal diary entries with photos. To enhance the sentimental aspect of the app, it automatically calculates milestones, such as every 100th day, 200th day, or their annual anniversary, celebrating their strong and stable relationship. The app also automatically sends an email to celebrate their anniversary, including curated data from their diary to help couples remember their special memories.

## Core Features:
- OAuth Integration for User Verification: Implement OAuth to securely verify user
identities and ensure a trusted environment for couples.
- Monogamous Diary Limit: Allow each diary to have a maximum of two members,
catering to monogamous couples who want to maintain a shared diary.
- Photo Integration: Enable users to post pictures along with diary content. Additionally,
provide the option to highlight a specific photo to serve as the selected cover photo for an
entry (for optional feature).
- Duration Tracking: Display the duration of time users have been active on the app
every day, allowing couples to track the progress of their journey together.
- Anniversary Celebrations: Automatically sends an email such as the 100th day, 200th day, or 1st-year anniversary of
their registration.
